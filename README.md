# Hand Gesture-Based Access Control System Using Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision

This project implements a novel access control system utilizing computer vision techniques and Raspberry Pi hardware. The system employs a Pi camera to capture live video and recognizes hand gestures for controlling access. An open palm gesture is interpreted as "on" to unlock the door, while a closed hand gesture signifies "off" to lock the door. A relay module is utilized to simulate the door mechanism, activating the relay to open or close the door based on the recognized gestures.

## Features

- Utilizes computer vision techniques for hand gesture recognition.
- Raspberry Pi hardware integration for real-time video processing.
- Control access using open and closed hand gestures.
- Simulates door mechanism with a relay module.
